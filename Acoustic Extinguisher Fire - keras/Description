The dataset was obtained as a result of the extinguishing tests of four different fuel flames with a sound wave extinguishing system. A total of 17,442 tests were conducted with this experimental setup. The experiments are planned as follows:

1. Three different liquid fuels and LPG fuel were used to create the flame.

2. 5 different sizes of liquid fuel cans are used to achieve different size of flames.

3. While carrying out each experiment, the fuel container, at 10 cm distance, was moved forward up to 190 cm by increasing the distance by 10 cm each time.

4. Along with the fuel container, anemometer and decibel meter were moved forward in the same dimensions.

5. Fire extinguishing experiments was conducted with 54 different frequency sound waves at each distance and flame size.

Status and fuel features are categorical, while other features are numerical. 8,759 of the 17,442 test results are the non-extinguishing state of the flame. 8,683 of them are the extinction state of the flame. According to these numbers, it can be said that the class distribution of the dataset is almost equal.
